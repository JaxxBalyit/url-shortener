# URL Shortner

This is a simple project that allows you to shorten a URL through an API. It's using **TinyUrl** as API, the logic is quite simple, but it can be very useful.

## Usage

Just find any link you want to shorten, put it inside the text box, and hit the shorten button.\
It also contains a reload button, which saves you the trouble of having to manually reload the page.\
As I said, it's a simple project, but it's made with all the love in the world ♥
I hope you like it.
